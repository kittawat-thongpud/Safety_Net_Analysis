# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains documentation and analytical framework for safety net system calculations. It is primarily a research/documentation project focused on engineering analysis of load-bearing capacity in safety net systems for fall protection applications.

## Repository Structure

- **Analytical Framework for Load-Bearing Capacity Calculation of Safety Net Systems.md** - Main technical paper with mathematical framework
- **Analytical Framework for Load-Bearing Capacity Calculation of Safety Net Systems.html** - HTML version of the paper
- **Analytical Framework for Load-Bearing Capacity Calculation of Safety Net Systems.pdf** - PDF version of the paper

## Key Technical Content

The repository contains a comprehensive analytical framework for calculating:
- Impact forces on safety net systems
- Maximum deflection under dynamic loading
- Stress distribution in net strands
- Safety factor calculations
- Energy conservation principles in impact scenarios

## Mathematical Framework

The analytical methodology includes:
- Energy conservation equations during impact
- Nonlinear force-deflection models
- Iterative solutions for maximum deflection
- Stress analysis and safety factor calculations
- Computational pipeline for engineering design

## Development Notes

This is primarily a documentation repository. There is no build system, package management, or executable code currently implemented. The content focuses on theoretical engineering analysis rather than software implementation.

## Common Tasks

- Review and analyze the mathematical framework
- Extract equations for implementation in other systems
- Convert analytical models into computational code
- Validate engineering calculations against the framework
