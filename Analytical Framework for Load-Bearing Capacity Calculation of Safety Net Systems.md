## 1 Introduction

Safety net systems are critical components in fall protection for construction and industrial applications. Traditional design approaches often rely on oversimplified assumptions, leading to either over-conservative designs or potential safety risks. This paper addresses this gap by developing a rigorous analytical framework that captures the complex mechanical behavior of net systems under impact loads. Our contribution includes a systematic equation pipeline that enables precise calculation of load-bearing capacity while considering material nonlinearity and dynamic effects.

## 2 Key Definitions

## 3 System Overview and Key Variables

### 3.1 System Configuration

The safety net system is modeled as a pre-tensioned membrane with boundary constraints, subjected to dynamic impact loading.

### 3.2 Key Analytical Relationships

The fundamental relationships governing system behavior are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Impact Velocity: } v_0 = \sqrt{2gh} \\
& \text{Kinetic Energy: } KE = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\
& \text{Strain Energy: } SE = \int_0^{\delta_{max}} F(\delta)d\delta \\
& \text{Energy Balance: } KE = SE + E_{diss}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 4 Analytical Methodology

### 4.1 Energy Conservation Principle

The foundation of our analysis begins with energy conservation during impact:

$$
\text{Kinetic Energy} = \text{Strain Energy} + \text{Energy Dissipation}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \int_0^{\delta_{max}} F(\delta)d\delta + E_{diss}
$$

where $F(\delta)$ represents the nonlinear force-deflection relationship.

### 4.2 Nonlinear Force-Deflection Model

The net system exhibits nonlinear stiffness characteristics:

$$
F(\delta) = k_1\delta + k_2\delta^2 + k_3\delta^3
$$

The stiffness coefficients are derived from material and geometric properties:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_1 &= \frac{nEA}{L} \cdot \cos^2\theta \\
k_2 &= \frac{nEA}{L^2} \cdot \sin\theta\cos^2\theta \\
k_3 &= \frac{nEA}{L^3} \cdot \sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of load-bearing strands and $\theta$ the net deformation angle.

### 4.3 Maximum Deflection Calculation

Substituting the force-deflection model into the energy equation:

$$
\frac{1}{2}m(2gh) = \int_0^{\delta_{max}} (k_1\delta + k_2\delta^2 + k_3\delta^3)d\delta
$$

$$
mgh = \frac{1}{2}k_1\delta_{max}^2 + \frac{1}{3}k_2\delta_{max}^3 + \frac{1}{4}k_3\delta_{max}^4
$$

This quartic equation is solved iteratively for $\delta_{max}$:

$$
\delta_{max}^{(i+1)} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{k_1}\left(mgh - \frac{1}{3}k_2[\delta_{max}^{(i)}]^3 - \frac{1}{4}k_3[\delta_{max}^{(i)}]^4\right)}
$$

### 4.4 Stress Analysis and Safety Factor

The maximum stress in net strands is calculated as:

$$
\sigma_{max} = E\varepsilon_{max} = E\left(\frac{\sqrt{L^2 + \delta_{max}^2} - L}{L}\right)
$$

The safety factor is then determined by:

$$
SF = \frac{\sigma_{yield}}{\sigma_{max}} \geq SF_{min}
$$

where $\sigma_{yield}$ is the material yield strength and $SF_{min}$ is the minimum required safety factor (typically 2.0-3.0).

### 4.5 Complete Computational Pipeline

The analytical procedure is summarized as follows:

**Input Parameters:**
- Mass and height: $m$, $h$
- Material properties: $E$, $A$, $\sigma_{yield}$
- Geometric parameters: $L$, $n$
- Safety requirement: $SF_{min}$

**Computational Steps:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Step 1: } v_0 = \sqrt{2gh} \\
&\text{Step 2: } k_1, k_2, k_3 = f(n, E, A, L) \\
&\text{Step 3: } \delta_{max} = \text{solve } mgh = \frac{1}{2}k_1\delta^2 + \frac{1}{3}k_2\delta^3 + \frac{1}{4}k_3\delta^4 \\
&\text{Step 4: } \sigma_{max} = E\left(\frac{\sqrt{L^2 + \delta_{max}^2} - L}{L}\right) \\
&\text{Step 5: } SF = \frac{\sigma_{yield}}{\sigma_{max}} \\
&\text{Output: } \delta_{max}, \sigma_{max}, SF
\end{aligned}
$$

**Validation Criteria:**
- $\delta_{max} \leq 0.15L$ (Maximum deflection limit)
- $SF \geq SF_{min}$ (Safety requirement)
- $\varepsilon_{max} \leq 0.1$ (Material strain limit)
